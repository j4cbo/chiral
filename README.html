<h3>Chiral</h3>
<p>
Chiral is a lightweight coroutine-based networking framework
for high-performance internet and Web services.
</p>

<p>
Coroutines in Chiral are based on Python 2.5's generators, as 
specified in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/">PEP 342</a>.
The Coroutine class wraps around a generator
and handles scheduling. Coroutines are expected to yield
WaitConditions, which carry the conditions for the coroutine to be
resumed again. This makes asynchronous networking simple and
straightforward; see the API documentation (docstrings) for more.
</p>

<p>
On top of Coroutines, Chiral provides:
</p>

<ul>
<li>TCP connection management</li>
<li>High-performance networking with epoll()</li>
<li>Introspection and on-the-fly code reloading</li>
<li>A fast HTTP server supporting WSGI, with extensions for Coroutine-based pages</li>
<li>A native memcached client</li>
<li>Deeply-integrated COMET support</li>
<li>In progress: an instant messaging framework; a thread pool system
for calling blocking code</li>
<li>Planned: asynchronous database access with DB-API or SQLAlchemy</li>
</ul>

<p>
Chiral development is currently inactive. Source is available from git.
